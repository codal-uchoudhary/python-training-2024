Python List

-> lists are mutable(changeble)
-> itration are time consuming
-> inserting and deleting items is easy
-> lists consume more memory


Python Tuple

-> tuples are immutable (we can't change)
-> itration are comparatively faster
-> Accessing the elements is best accomplished with a tuple data type
-> Tuple consumes less memory than the list



Note: main difference is that lists are mutable and tuples are immutable
